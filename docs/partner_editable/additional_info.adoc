// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Post-deployment steps
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading
To test the system properly, the system requires to have a valid DNS entry pointing to the server's network load balancer's(NLB) ARN and also the NLB have SSL certificates and Elastic IPs attached to it. 

Update your DNS and add two entries. One each for the web tier and video call tier. Take the ARNs of the network load balancers and add the appropriate entry in your DNS server.

After the DNS propagation, the servers will be accessible via https://<The domain name entered by you in the template>/. in a browser 
The browser will show a login page and you can test the login using username "jsnow" and password "jsnow".  You will be able to change/disable the test user accounts via the identity management system included in the stack.

== Security
Only port 22 is open at startup. You can restrict this port by providing an IP address or range of IP addresses for the AdminIngressLocation parameter. If you want to open
these ports to everyone, set the IP address to 0.0.0.0/0. However, this is not advised because it leaves your instances insecure.
