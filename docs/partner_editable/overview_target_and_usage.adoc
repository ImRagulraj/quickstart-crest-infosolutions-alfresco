This guide provides instructions for deploying the CloudMeet Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users whos organizations were unprepared to deal with the challenges associated with the culture of work from home. There were challenges to keep the staff virtually connected with each-other, drive communication across teams, departments and organization, make announcements, and even hold meetings virtually, rather than booking a meeting room.

CloudMeet can address the current market needs completely and offers a fully secure, private, end-to-end encrypted and self-hosted unified communication platform. CloudMeet offers the following features to customers:

** Schedule and Conduct Online Meetings from any browser or iOS and Android devices.
** Instant Chat, Team Chat with group chat and file sharing features.
** Conduct Audio/video conferencing from any browser or iOS and Android devices.
** Channels (Public, Private and Broadcast Channels) for departmental or across organization delivered directly to userâ€™s device.
