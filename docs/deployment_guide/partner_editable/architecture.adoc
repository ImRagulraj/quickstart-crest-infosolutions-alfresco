image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with three private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the private subnets, AWS Fargate, located in an Auto Scaling group, to provide on-demand, compute capacity for containers. 
* An internet gateway to allow access to the internet.*
* A Network Load Balancer to balance traffic between Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) instances.
* Container images, stored in a public Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR).
