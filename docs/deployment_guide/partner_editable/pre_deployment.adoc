== Predeployment steps

=== Prepare the access keys for DynamoDB access

This Quick Start requires an access key and its secret key that should be generated using the AWS Identity and Access Management(IAM) service. These values such as access key, secret key and region will be used to access the DynamoDB table.

=== Prepare your Domain Name System (DNS) account (OPTIONAL)

This Quick Start requires two subdomains with SSL certificates, which should be uploaded to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) before deployment. The domain name should be registered in your company's DNS servers.

Note that the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate is required only for production deployments and not for the evaluation setup.
